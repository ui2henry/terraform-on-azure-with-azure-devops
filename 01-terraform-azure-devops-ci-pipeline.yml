# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

# trigger:
# - main

# pool:
#   vmImage: ubuntu-latest

# steps:
# - script: echo Hello, world!
#   displayName: 'Run a one-line script'

# - script: |
#     echo Add other tasks to build, test, and deploy your project.
#     echo See https://aka.ms/yaml
#   displayName: 'Run a multi-line script'

trigger:
- main

# Stages
# Stage-1:
  # Task-1: Copy terraform-manifests files to Build Artifact Directory
  # Task-2: Publish build articats to Azure Pipelines
# Pipeline Hierarchial Flow: Stages -> Stage -> Jobs -> Job -> Steps -> Task1, Task2, Task3  

stages:
# Build Stage 
- stage: Build
  displayName: Build Stage
  jobs:
  - job: Build
    displayName: Build Job
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
